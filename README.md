# CS 229 Machine Learning at Stanford University, taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

[Fall 2023 Course Website]

[Course Website](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)

I'm self-learning this class through YouTube to
* Take a step further and explore more about machine learning.
* Get a head start on concepts to my ML classes next quarter, so I will be more prepared.

I'll gain a more thorough understanding by learning from supplementary materials from CS 189 (Introduction to Machine Learning) at UC Berkeley, 10-601 at CMU (Introduction to Machine Learning), and EECS 127 at UC Berkeley (Optimization Models in Engineering).

To get a solid understanding of course material, I am also doing the following activities during the winter break:
* Review Linear Algebra concepts through MIT's 18.06, taught by Prof. Gilbert Strang.
* Review Multivariable Calculus concepts through Stanford Math 51 Notes.
* Review Probability concepts through the textbook *A First Course in Probability*.
